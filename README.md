**Warehouse-Inventory-Analysis**
Interactive dashboard for tracking inventory quantity, expiry status, and product condition.

This project is a Warehouse Inventory Analysis Dashboard developed using Power BI to monitor and analyze warehouse data efficiently.
The dashboard provides insights into product quantity, category distribution, expiry status, and inventory condition to support data-driven decision-making.
Key metrics such as total categories, total items, and total quantity are displayed using KPI cards for quick understanding.
Interactive visualizations including treemap, donut charts, and year-wise analysis help identify high-volume categories, expiry risks in food and health & beauty products, and product status distribution such as active, hold, damaged, and reserved items.
This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard design using real-world warehouse data.

The data for this project was sourced from an Excel-based warehouse inventory dataset, created and structured for analytical and visualization purposes.
